# Slalom Coding Challenge

I will be using this coding challenge to learn Java Spring and create REST endpoints for each challenge. I will not
be focusing on creating UIs on top of my end points. Learn more at [I’ll be Learning Java Spring Boot through a Coding Challenge, join me!](https://davidlozzi.com/2021/04/19/ill-be-learning-java-spring-boot-through-a-coding-challenge-join-me/).

## The Challenges

There will be 6 challenges total:

### Challenge 1 - Calculator

A great starting challenge. Super simple, lets me get to know Java some, create my first project. I created a basic REST endpoint to calculate some math.

### Challenge 2 - Pomodoro

A challenging challenge, as I wouldn't put a timer in an API, I'd let the front-end handle it, BUT I am learning, and did find some new things in this challenge. Learn more here: coming shortly.
