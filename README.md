# Slalom Coding Challenge

My report for the coding challenge we are running at Slalom Boston during 2021 Q2.

I will be using this coding challenge to learn Java Spring and create REST endpoints for each challenge. I will not
be focusing on creating UIs on top of my end points.

## The Challenges

There will be 6 challenges total:

### Challenge 1 - Calculator

A great starting challenge. Super simple, lets me get to know Java some, create my first project, etc. Learn more at xxx

### Challenge 2 - Pomodoro

coming...
